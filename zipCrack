crack this encrypted zip


ChatGPT said:
To help you crack the encrypted ZIP file, we’ll use a brute-force or dictionary attack approach. Below are step-by-step instructions using a popular tool called fcrackzip and another more powerful option, John the Ripper, depending on your setup.

🔧 Option 1: Using fcrackzip (fast & simple)
📌 Step 1: Install fcrackzip
Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install fcrackzip
Mac (Homebrew):

bash
Copy
Edit
brew install fcrackzip
Windows: Use WSL or install Cygwin + fcrackzip.

📌 Step 2: Basic Brute Force Attack
bash
Copy
Edit
fcrackzip -v -b -c a1 -l 1-6 /path/to/Encrypted.zip
-v: verbose

-b: brute force

-c a1: use lowercase letters (a) and digits (1)

-l 1-6: try passwords between 1 and 6 characters

Replace /path/to/Encrypted.zip with your actual file path.

📌 Step 3: Dictionary Attack (faster if you have a wordlist)
If you have a dictionary (e.g., rockyou.txt):

bash
Copy
Edit
fcrackzip -v -D -p rockyou.txt /path/to/Encrypted.zip
💪 Option 2: Using John the Ripper (more powerful)
📌 Step 1: Install John and zip2john
On Ubuntu/Debian:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install john
📌 Step 2: Extract hash from ZIP
bash
Copy
Edit
zip2john /path/to/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
📌 Step 3: Crack the password
bash
Copy
Edit
john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
You can also run a brute force attack using:

bash
Copy
Edit
john zip_hash.txt --incremental
📌 Step 4: View the cracked password
bash
Copy
Edit
john --show zip_hash.txt
❓ Next Step for You
Would you like me to extract the password for you here, or guide you through running the commands locally?

Let me know your setup (Windows/Mac/Linux), and if you want me to try cracking it with a dictionary right now using my tools.

ChatGPT said:
Got it! The error means zip2john is not in your current path. It’s part of the John the Ripper "jumbo" version, but not always included by default in system packages.

Let’s get you set up correctly:

✅ Step-by-Step: Install John the Ripper (with zip2john) on Ubuntu
📌 Step 1: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential git zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libgmp-dev libpcap-dev yasm pkg-config
📌 Step 2: Clone the Jumbo Version of John
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/openwall/john.git
cd john/src
📌 Step 3: Compile John
bash
Copy
Edit
./configure && make -s clean && make -sj$(nproc)
This takes a couple of minutes depending on your CPU.

📌 Step 4: Add John to Your PATH (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'"$(pwd)/../run" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Or, just run John from the build directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../run
./zip2john ~/path/to/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
Replace ~/path/to/Encrypted.zip with the actual path.

Once that’s done, you can use zip2john and john just like in the previous steps.

Let me know if you'd like me to try cracking it for you right now instead — I can attempt a wordlist attack on the file you uploaded.

ChatGPT said:
Alright! Since you're still getting zip2john: command not found, let's make sure you're running it from the right folder after building John the Ripper from source.

🔁 Quick Fix: Run zip2john directly from its location
Assuming you've already followed the steps to compile it, try this:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/john/run
./zip2john ~/Encrypted.zip > ~/zip_hash.txt
Replace ~/Encrypted.zip with the full path if needed.

If you haven't cloned and built John yet, here’s the short version again:

🚀 1. Clone & Build John:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install git build-essential
git clone https://github.com/openwall/john.git
cd john/src
./configure && make -s clean && make -sj$(nproc)
🚀 2. Run zip2john:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../run
./zip2john ~/Encrypted.zip > ~/zip_hash.txt
🚀 3. Crack with Wordlist (like rockyou.txt):
bash
Copy
Edit
./john ~/zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Need help getting rockyou.txt or want me to just try it here with your uploaded file? I can do that too — just say the word.







You said:
chopp@choppsiggity:~/john/run$ ./zip2john ~/path/to/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
bash: ./zip2john: No such file or directory
chopp@choppsiggity:~/john/run$ ./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
bash: ./john: No such file or directory
chopp@choppsiggity:~/john/run$ 


ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update — it looks like the john/run/ directory doesn’t contain the compiled binaries yet, which means the build step likely didn’t finish or didn’t work as expected.

Let’s go through a quick checklist to fix it:

✅ Step-by-Step Fix
📌 Step 1: Go to Source Folder
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/john/src
📌 Step 2: Build John the Ripper (this is crucial)
bash
Copy
Edit
./configure && make -s clean && make -sj$(nproc)
This step can take a few minutes. If you see any errors during this step, send them to me and I’ll help troubleshoot.

📌 Step 3: After Build, Go to run Folder
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../run
Now check if zip2john and john exist:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls zip2john john
You should see both files listed. If you do, you're good to go.

✅ Then Run the Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
./zip2john ~/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
If you don’t have rockyou.txt, install it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wordlists
gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
Let me know if anything fails during these steps — or if you want me to try cracking the zip here using the file you uploaded earlier. I can do that now.

configure: error: in /home/chopp/john/src':
configure: error: OpenSSL headers not found, install them or use --without-openssl option
See config.log' for more details
chopp@choppsiggity:~/john/src$ 


ChatGPT said:
Thanks! That error means you’re missing the OpenSSL development headers, which are required to build John the Ripper.

✅ Quick Fix: Install OpenSSL Development Headers
Run this:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install libssl-dev
Then try building again:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/john/src
./configure && make -s clean && make -sj$(nproc)
Let that run, and once it finishes:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../run
ls zip2john john
If they show up, you're golden ✅

Let me know how it goes — or again, happy to try cracking the ZIP here while you set up!

cat zip_hash.txt
If you see a long line starting with Encrypted.zip:$pkzip2$ — you're good.

🔹 Step 3: Crack It with RockYou
If you don’t have the wordlist yet:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wordlists
gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
🔹 Step 4: Display the Cracked Password
bash
Copy
Edit
./john --show zip_hash.txt
Let it run and report back with the cracked password, or I can crack the uploaded ZIP here using the same method.

Your call — want me to try cracking it right now?

Looks like the file path ~/Encrypted.zip isn’t correct — the file probably isn’t in your home directory.

Let’s find the correct path for the encrypted ZIP file:

🔍 Step 1: Locate the File
Run this to search for it:

bash
Copy
Edit
find ~ -name "Encrypted.zip" 2>/dev/null
This will search your home directory for the file and show the exact path.

✅ Step 2: Use That Path with zip2john
Once you have the correct full path (e.g., /home/chopp/Downloads/Encrypted.zip), run:

bash
Copy
Edit
./zip2john /full/path/to/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
Let me know what find turns up, and I’ll walk you through the next step.

You're super close! 🔐

You just need to use the correct full path. Based on your find output, your ZIP file is here:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
/home/chopp/Downloads/0xNCL/Encrypted.zip
So now, run this exact command:

bash
Copy
Edit
./zip2john /home/chopp/Downloads/0xNCL/Encrypted.zip > zip_hash.txt
Then continue with:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
And finally:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john --show zip_hash.txt
Let it run and crack that password 🧠💥

Let me know what it outputs!

Perfect progress! You're 99% there. The only issue now is that rockyou.txt isn’t installed yet — let’s fix that in one quick command:

✅ Step to Install RockYou Wordlist
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wordlists
Then unzip it (it comes compressed):

bash
Copy
Edit
gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
🔁 Retry the Crack
Now run:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
And once it's done or finds the password:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john --show zip_hash.txt
Let it rip 🔥 and tell me what it finds!

ChatGPT said:
No worries — that just means the package list may be outdated or the wordlist package isn’t available by default in your sources. Let’s fix that:

✅ Step 1: Update Your Package List
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
Then try again:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install wordlists
If that still doesn’t work, here’s the manual way:

✅ Option B: Manually Download rockyou.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /usr/share/wordlists/
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/master/rockyou.txt
Now you have it — then go back to:

bash
Copy
Edit
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Let me know if you want me to just run the crack for you here — I’ve got the tools ready on my end too.

Ahh yeah, looks like that link’s outdated or the file was removed. Let me give you a working one, and also avoid /usr/share/wordlists since it doesn’t exist on your system.

✅ Step-by-Step: Download RockYou Locally to Your Run Folder
📌 Step 1: Use this working URL:
bash
Copy
Edit
wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
📌 Step 2: Extract the file
bash
Copy
Edit
tar -xzvf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
That will give you rockyou.txt right in your current directory (~/john/run).

✅ Step 3: Crack the ZIP with That Wordlist
bash
Copy
Edit
./john zip_hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
✅ Step 4: Display Cracked Password
bash
Copy
Edit
./john --show zip_hash.txt
You're all set. Go ahead and run it — I’ve got popcorn ready for the password reveal 🍿😄
